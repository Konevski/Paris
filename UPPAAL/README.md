# UPPAAL Demo for a First Come First Serve model. 
### Author: Gordan

Traffic System.xml - proper demo
Traffic Sysrem-loop.xml - demo with an endless, repeating cycle

- `Note:` None of the demos use a clock, since it would have been a redundant element to a First Come First Serve model.
- `Note:` This model is intended to be used as a referrence point to its FreeRTOS alternative.
