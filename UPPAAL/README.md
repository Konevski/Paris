# UPPAAL Demo for a First Come First Serve model. 
### Author: Gordan

- Traffic System.xml - proper demo
- Traffic Sysrem-loop.xml - demo with an endless, repeating cycle

1. `Note:` None of the demos use a clock, since it would have been a redundant element to a First Come First Serve model.
2. `Note:` This model is intended to be used as a referrence point to its FreeRTOS alternative and is not representative of the final algorithm.
