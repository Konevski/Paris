# Team Paris
we are developing an autonomus traffic intersection using a vehical to vehical and vehical to infractucture communication. we are simulating an ideal environment.

# Requirnments:

## intersection communiction infracture:
- It should be able to communicate with multiple vehicals at the same time
- It should assign priority to the incoming vehicals
- It should have a wide rage of detection
- 
## vehicals:
- It should autonomus
- It should communicate with the intersection communiction infracture
- It should communicate with othe vehicals

## Roads
- It shoud be a 4 way intersection with one way in one way out of the interection
- it should have lines to detect approaching vehicals

# USE CASE
## intersection communiction infracture
- it detects the approaching vehical once the line is crossed.
- it recieves the destination of the approaching vehicals
- it assignes the priority of th vehical on the bases of FIFO(first come first served)
- it assignes weather the vehical has to wait or not

## vehical
- it sends the destination data to the intersection communiction infracture
- it has to wait according to the assigned priority
- communicate with other vehicals for colission avoidence


- ## Team Members: 
- Wiktor Kochanek
- Aditya Kumar
- Gordan Konevski
- `Arsal Abbasi` (forfieted)
